# React Router Photo Gallery Colter
Get to know React Router by building yourself a small photo gallery site.

## Objectives

- Adding dependencies to your React Project
- Navigating JSON data structures
- Using the React Router library
- Using parameters in React Router

## Requirements

Using the JSON data below as a starter, build a photo gallery app. Here's
[an example](https://things-i-like.netlify.com/).

```json

  "pandas": {
    "title": "Panda Bears",

    ]
  }
}
```

Save this as a JSON file in your project and import it.

If you hot-link photos from the internet, be sure to include a valid link back to the source.

- [ ] You should have at least 4 components: `App`, `CategoryList`, `PhotoList`, `PhotoDetail`.
- [ ] On the home page, your category list should render the title of each category and link using the key. For examples "Panda Bears" should link to `/pandas`
- [ ] Render each photo in the given category on the photo list page with a thumbnail-sized version of your photos.
- [ ] Render a large version of the photo on the photo details page.

- [ ] Customize the given data to include your own photos and categories.
- [ ] Add bread crumb navigation, as seen in the example.
- [ ] Add a thumbnail to the first photo in each category to the home page, as seen in the example.
